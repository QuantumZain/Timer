# Timer
A crappy timer written very inefficiently but it works

Medhat if you want to use a different audio file for your alarm then Make sure:
1. To delete or remove the current GOAT.wav file
2. The new audio file is a .wav file. Use this site to convert any sound file to .wav https://online-audio-converter.com/
3. it's renamed to GOAT
